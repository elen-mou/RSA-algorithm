## About the Project
A simple implementation for the algorithm of the RSA encryption-decryption method, allowing the user to encrypt or decrypt a message based on the provided input. It takes user inputs, performs various validation checks, and calculates values like the greatest common divisor (GCD), Euler's totient function (phi), and modular exponentiation to achieve encryption and decryption. It implements basic cryptographic principles as well, such as verifying if the provided prime numbers are valid and ensuring that the encryption and decryption exponents are coprime with Euler's totient of the product of two primes.
